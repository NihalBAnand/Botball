# Botball
This is a repository for the 2019 Perry Botball team 4.
Here is where we store our libraries and our point-scoring code.

The **lib** file is for our libraries, including sensors, movement functions, and other utilities.
Stuff outside of that file is *point-scoring*, meaning that it programs the movements of the robot in order to score points, using the libraries.

Have any issues? Open an issue, and we'll solve it.

Thanks,

The programming crew
